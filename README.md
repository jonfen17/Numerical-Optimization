# Numerical-Optimization

Matlab Codes for Applied Analyisis Course (Numerical Optimization for Quadratic Functions).
Spring 2015. ITAM

In this course we study optimization methods for solving the following problem:

 min  F(x) = x'*A*x + B*x + C     No restrictions  ... (1)

This repository's goal is to have functional codes for solving  (1). The methods are the following

1. Newton method
2. Newton method with Steepest Descent (Bisection & Strong Wolfe Conditions)
3. Newton method with Conjugate Gradient
4. Newton method with Conjugate Gradient and Trust-Region
5. BFGS with Line Search Algorithm
6. BFGS with Conjugate Gradient and Trust-Region
7. L-BFGS (Limited Memory)
